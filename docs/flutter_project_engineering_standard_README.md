Here's your comprehensive README for `flutter_project_engineering_standard.md`, modelled exactly on the patterns established by `architecture_README.md` and `security_README.md`.The container is temporarily rate-limited. Here is the full README directly in the response — you can copy it into your project as `docs/engineering_standard_README.md`.

## What does `flutter_project_engineering_standard.md` say?

It is a **master rulebook** for building any Flutter application to a consistent, maintainable, and shippable standard. Unlike `architecture.md` (which describes *your specific project*) and `security.md` (which covers *your specific threat model*), the engineering standard is **project-agnostic** — it defines rules that apply to *every* Flutter app you build.

It has 24 sections across every dimension of Flutter development. Here is the map:

**Sections 1–4 — Foundations.** How to apply the standard (conformance language: `MUST`/`SHOULD`/`MAY`, three applicability profiles, repository types), nine core principles, when to use Tier 1 (layer-first) vs Tier 2 (feature-first) structure, the state management rules, the canonical Widget → State → Service → Repository → Datasource data flow, and the mandatory `main()` initialization sequence.

**Sections 5–9 — App-level engineering.** Build flavors and when they are required, the `AppFlavorConfig` pattern, MSIX packaging for Windows, which Android artifact to use when. UI/UX baseline: theme tokens, screen-state patterns (loading/empty/success/error), feedback component rules (SnackBar vs AlertDialog vs BottomSheet), animation duration tokens with easing curves, haptic feedback rules, keyboard/scroll behavior, and safe area handling. Accessibility: touch targets, contrast ratios, semantics, font scaling at 1.0×/1.5×/2.0×, focus and keyboard navigation, screen reader testing. Localization minimum setup. App lifecycle management with `WidgetsBindingObserver`.

**Sections 10–15 — Quality and safety.** Performance: frame budget targets, widget rebuild optimization, list rendering rules, image memory rules, isolates for background work, startup targets, and the app size budget table. Error handling: global boundaries in `main()`, four-tier classification (recoverable/degraded/session/fatal), repository-layer error wrapping, and UI error presentation. Code generation: `build_runner` commands and the generated file policy. Database: versioned migration strategy, WAL mode, index strategy, integrity constraints. Logging: six-level taxonomy, what to never log, what to log per layer, log rotation. Security: core rules for all apps, Sensitive Data Extension requirements, OWASP Mobile Top 10 checklist.

**Sections 16–24 — Standards and process.** Coding standards including the recommended `analysis_options.yaml` lint rules. Asset management (WebP/SVG formats, 2×/3× variants, font licensing). Testing levels per profile. CI minimum and production checklists. Git hygiene. Documentation requirements. AI coding assistant instructions. The Definition of Done checklists. Practical one-liner lessons.

## How do you use it in a Flutter project?

Think of it as three things simultaneously.

**1. A decision eliminator before you start.** The standard resolves most common architectural debates in advance. You do not need to debate `ListView` vs `ListView.builder` for a 100-item list, what error handler goes in `main()`, how to initialize `sqflite` on Windows, or which easing curve to use for an entering element. The standard answers those questions once. You follow the answer and move on.

**2. A quality gate during development.** Section 23 (Definition of Done) gives you a concrete checklist before every task is closed. `flutter analyze` clean, tests updated, generated files current, no secrets staged. This turns vague "is it done?" into a binary check.

**3. A profile selector for different project types.** Not every rule applies to every project. The three profiles are:

| Profile | Applies To |
|---------|-----------|
| `Core Baseline` | Every Flutter app, no exceptions |
| `Production App Extension` | Apps shipped to real users, QA, or a store |
| `Sensitive Data Extension` | Apps handling secrets, health, financial, or PII data |

You declare the active profiles in `architecture.md §1`. Rules marked "under Production App Extension" only activate once that profile is declared.

## What should you fill out before starting the project?

The engineering standard is **not a fill-in-the-blanks template**. You do not write into it. You **read it and make decisions from it**, then record those decisions in `architecture.md` and `security.md`.

### Part 1 — Decisions to make before writing code

| Priority | Section | Decision to Make and Record |
|----------|---------|----------------------------|
| 🔴 Must | **§1 Profiles** | Declare which profiles apply. Record in `architecture.md §1`. |
| 🔴 Must | **§3 Structure** | Choose Tier 1 or Tier 2. Record in `architecture.md §4` with the reason. |
| 🔴 Must | **§4.1 State management** | Confirm one primary package. Record in `architecture.md §8`. |
| 🔴 Must | **§4.2 Data flow** | Confirm the canonical chain or document any omitted layer. Record in `architecture.md §9`. |
| 🔴 Must | **§4.5 Init sequence** | Plan the exact `main()` order. Record in `architecture.md §5`. |
| 🔴 Must | **§5 Build config** | Decide if flavors are needed now. Plan the `AppFlavorConfig` if yes. Record in `architecture.md §15`. |
| 🔴 Must | **§13 Database** | Confirm WAL mode on, FK enforcement on, migration strategy. Record in `architecture.md §14`. |
| 🔴 Must | **§14 Logging** | Confirm logger package and what must never be logged. Record in `architecture.md §17`. |
| 🟡 Soon | **§11 Error handling** | Draft the sealed `AppException` hierarchy before the first repository is written. Record in `architecture.md §10`. |
| 🟡 Soon | **§15 Security** | Decide sensitivity level and active profile. Feed decisions into `security.md §1–§4`. |
| 🟡 Soon | **§16.1 Lints** | Copy the recommended `analysis_options.yaml` into the project root before writing the first Dart file. |
| 🟡 Soon | **§19 CI** | Set up the minimum CI workflow before the first merge to main. |
| 🟢 Later | **§6 UI/UX** | Reference animation tokens and feedback component rules as each screen is built. |
| 🟢 Later | **§7 Accessibility** | Verify touch targets, contrast, and semantics as each widget is built. |
| 🟢 Later | **§10 Performance** | Reference frame budget and list rules as each screen is built. |
| 🟢 Later | **§23 Done checklist** | Walk through before marking any task complete. |

### Part 2 — Setup tasks the standard mandates before coding

**Copy `analysis_options.yaml` lint rules** — Section 16.1 provides the full recommended rule set. Create this file before the first Dart file. Lint problems are cheapest to fix before patterns embed.

**Set up CI with minimum checks** — Section 19.1: `flutter pub get` → `build_runner` → `dart format` → `flutter analyze` → `flutter test`. Set this up before the first code lands, not after.

**Configure `flutter_localizations` in `MaterialApp`** — Section 8.1. Without `GlobalMaterialLocalizations` delegates, certain Material widgets render incorrectly on non-English system locales. A one-line fix at project creation that prevents a confusing bug later.

**Run the dependency audit for offline apps** — Section 16.5. For fully offline apps, `dart pub deps --style=tree` must be run before adding any package. This verifies no transitive HTTP dependency is introduced. Architecturally mandatory, not optional.

**Create `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/security.md`** — Section 21.1 lists these as required documents. Fill out all 🔴 Must sections in both before coding begins.

## How can AI use this document? What do you need to do?

### How AI uses it

When the standard is placed in `docs/` and referenced in `CLAUDE.md`, an AI coding assistant reads it and gains a complete picture of *how* code should be written — not just what to build.

**Structure** — It knows the tier, avoids a second `utils/` folder, and never invents a second state management system.

**Data flow** — It knows Widget → State → Service → Repository → Datasource. It will not put SQL inside a widget or put navigation logic inside a service.

**Init order** — It knows `sqfliteFfiInit()` before database open, database open before `runApp()`. Wrong ordering causes silent release-only crashes; the standard explains why.

**List rendering** — It knows `ListView(children:[...])` is prohibited for lists over ~20 items. It uses `ListView.builder` with `itemExtent` when item height is fixed.

**Error handling** — It knows to catch `SqliteException` at the repository layer, re-throw typed `AppException`, and never expose stack traces or exception class names to the user.

**Logging** — It knows `print` and `debugPrint` are banned in committed code, trace/debug must be gated by flavor config, and all error logs must include the `error` object and `stackTrace`.

**Animation** — It knows `Curves.easeOut` for entering elements, `Curves.easeIn` for leaving elements, `MediaQuery.disableAnimations` must be respected, and `Padding` values must never be animated (they trigger layout recalculation; use `Transform` or `Opacity`).

**Code generation** — It knows whether generated files are committed or excluded in your project, and will regenerate them after modifying annotated source.

**Definition of done** — It knows a task is not complete until `flutter analyze` is clean, tests are updated, generated files are current, and no secrets are staged.

Without the standard, the AI applies its own defaults — which may be inconsistent with your project's patterns and which can vary between sessions.

### What you need to do

**Step 1 — Place the standard in your docs folder**
```
<project_root>/docs/flutter_project_engineering_standard.md
```

**Step 2 — Add a rule to `CLAUDE.md`**

```
Rule N: Before writing any code, read docs/flutter_project_engineering_standard.md.
        Active profiles: Core Baseline, Production App Extension.

  Structure: Follow architecture.md §4 tier. No second state-management system.
             No packages introducing transitive HTTP or network activity.

  Code rules (every task):
  - Never use ListView(children:[...]) for lists over 20 items.
  - Never use print() or debugPrint(); use AppLogger.
  - Never animate Padding values; use Transform or Opacity.
  - Never put SQL, encryption, or HTTP knowledge inside a widget.
  - Always add const to constructors and widget instantiations where possible.
  - Always add a Semantics label to custom interactive widgets.
  - Always use compute() or Isolate for work taking more than ~4 ms.

  Definition of done (every task):
  - flutter analyze clean. Tests added/updated. Generated files current.
  - No secrets, build output, or local machine files staged.
```

**Step 3 — Reference specific sections when asking for code**

Instead of: *"Write the TodoRepository"*
Say: *"Following engineering standard §4.2 data flow and §11.3 repository error handling, write the TodoRepository. Catch SqliteException and re-throw typed StorageException. Never log field content."*

Instead of: *"Build the todo list screen"*
Say: *"Following engineering standard §6.3 screen-state guidance, §6.4 feedback components, and §10.3 list performance rules, build the todo list screen. ListView.builder, skeleton loader, SnackBar with undo for delete."*

**Step 4 — Use §23 as a review checklist after receiving AI output**

After the AI delivers code, quickly verify: `const` constructors used, `ListView.builder` for any sizeable list, no SQL in widgets, no silently swallowed errors, tests added, `flutter analyze` clean. If any check fails, cite the section and ask for a correction.

**Step 5 — The standard is project-level ground truth — not a per-session upload**

Once in `docs/` and referenced in `CLAUDE.md`, every future session reads it automatically alongside `architecture.md` and `security.md`. You do not re-explain it. Per task you indicate which sections are most relevant — this focuses the AI precisely rather than asking it to apply all 24 sections equally to every small change.

## How the three documents work together

| Document | Answers |
|----------|---------|
| `flutter_project_engineering_standard.md` | *How* should all Flutter code be written? Universal rules for every project. |
| `architecture.md` | *What* did this specific project decide? Tier, packages, schema, routes. |
| `security.md` | *What* does this specific project protect? What is sensitive, what is never logged, how is data encrypted? |

All three are needed to write correct code. The engineering standard gives the pattern. `architecture.md` gives the type names and layer locations. `security.md` constrains what the logger inside any given method is allowed to emit. Referencing all three when asking the AI for a non-trivial implementation gives it everything required to produce code that is correct, consistent with your project, and safe.
