# Flutter Project Engineering Standard

This document is a reusable engineering standard for future Flutter projects.

It is intentionally layered. Small apps should inherit the core baseline without being forced into
release-process or high-security requirements that do not fit the product.

---

## 1. How To Use This Standard

### 1.1 Conformance Language

Use these terms consistently:

- `MUST`: mandatory for the stated scope.
- `SHOULD`: expected default; deviations require a reason.
- `MAY`: optional.

### 1.2 Applicability Profiles

Every Flutter repository MUST declare which profile applies.

| Profile | Applies To | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| `Core Baseline` | All Flutter application repositories | Universal maintainability and code-quality rules |
| `Production App Extension` | Apps shipped to real users, external QA, or store review | Release, CI, UX, and environment discipline |
| `Sensitive Data Extension` | Apps handling auth secrets, financial data, health data, PII, or locally encrypted content | Stronger security, storage, logging, and backup rules |

A simple internal tool may use only `Core Baseline`.
A public consumer app will usually use `Core Baseline` plus `Production App Extension`.
An authenticator, password manager, finance, or health app will usually use all three.

### 1.3 Repository Types

This document primarily targets Flutter application repositories.

If the repository is a Flutter package or plugin:

- `android/`, `ios/`, and build-flavor rules MAY be omitted if not applicable.
- `pubspec.lock` SHOULD follow package conventions rather than application conventions.
- UI, release, and integration-test requirements apply only if the package ships runnable example apps.

---

## 2. Core Principles

1. Structure by responsibility first, then by implementation detail.
2. Keep business logic outside widgets.
3. Prefer explicit code over clever abstractions.
4. Enforce standards through tooling where practical.
5. One repository SHOULD have one clear way to do state, navigation, theming, errors, and testing.
6. Optimize for current complexity, not hypothetical future complexity.
7. Security and logging policy are product requirements, not cleanup work.
8. Performance is a feature; it is designed in, not bolted on.
9. Accessibility is a correctness requirement, not a nice-to-have.

---

## 3. Project Structure

### 3.1 Choose The Simplest Layout That Fits

#### Tier 1: Layer-First

Use for smaller apps, single-domain apps, or early products.

```text
lib/
|-- config/
|-- models/
|-- providers/        # Or controllers/blocs/cubits
|-- screens/
|-- services/
|-- widgets/
`-- main.dart
```

#### Tier 2: Feature-First

Use when multiple product areas evolve independently or when several developers routinely touch
unrelated features.

```text
lib/
|-- app/
|   |-- config/
|   |-- routing/
|   `-- theme/
|-- core/
|   |-- errors/
|   |-- lifecycle/
|   |-- logging/
|   |-- network/
|   |-- security/
|   |-- storage/
|   `-- widgets/
|-- features/
|   `-- <feature_name>/
|       |-- data/
|       |-- domain/
|       `-- presentation/
`-- main.dart
```

Promote from Tier 1 to Tier 2 only when the current shape creates actual boundary confusion,
naming collisions, or merge friction.

### 3.2 Structure Rules

These rules apply to all app repositories.

- `main.dart` MUST stay thin: framework initialization, config loading, provider or DI setup,
  then `runApp`. Heavy initialization MUST be moved to a startup service.
- A broad catch-all `utils/` directory SHOULD be avoided. If a `utils/` folder starts collecting
  unrelated concerns, split it into named locations.
- `test/` SHOULD mirror `lib/` closely enough that ownership is obvious.
- Platform directories MUST NOT contain business logic that belongs in Dart unless platform
  constraints require it.

### 3.3 Recommended Root Layout For App Repositories

```text
project/
|-- android/                  # Optional for non-Android targets or packages
|-- ios/                      # Optional for non-iOS targets or packages
|-- windows/                  # Optional for non-Windows targets
|-- linux/                    # Optional
|-- macos/                    # Optional
|-- assets/
|   |-- fonts/
|   |-- icons/
|   `-- images/
|       |-- 2.0x/
|       `-- 3.0x/
|-- docs/
|-- lib/
|-- test/
|-- integration_test/         # Required only when end-to-end coverage applies
|-- .github/workflows/
|-- analysis_options.yaml
|-- pubspec.yaml
|-- README.md
`-- .gitignore
```

Application repositories SHOULD commit `pubspec.lock`.
Packages and plugins SHOULD follow normal package conventions.

---

## 4. Architecture Baseline

### 4.1 State Management

- SHOULD use one primary state-management approach per repository. Deviations are permissible
  when documented: name the second pattern, name the boundary where it applies, and commit to
  not crossing that boundary. A common legitimate case is using `ValueNotifier` or `setState`
  for purely local widget state while Riverpod or Bloc handles cross-widget and persistent state.
- Do not mix multiple state systems for the same problem. The restriction is on competing
  solutions to the same concern, not on the total count of patterns in the repository.
- Providers, controllers, or blocs MUST expose UI-facing state and transitions, not raw storage
  primitives.
- State layers MUST NOT import widget classes.

### 4.2 Data Flow

Preferred flow:

```text
Widget -> State Layer -> Service or Use Case -> Repository -> Datasource
```

Not every Tier 1 app needs an explicit repository layer. Introduce `Repository` and `Datasource`
boundaries when they reduce complexity or isolate external systems cleanly.

Rules:

- Widgets MUST NOT know SQL, encryption, HTTP, or storage implementation details.
- Services SHOULD be stateless where practical.
- Singletons SHOULD be limited to infrastructure concerns such as database access, app config, or
  logging.
- Services MUST NOT decide UI copy or navigation policy.

### 4.3 Models And Entities

- Prefer immutable models.
- In Tier 1, a single model MAY serve both storage and UI if the shape is simple.
- In Tier 2, transport models and domain entities SHOULD diverge when the serialization shape and
  business shape differ.
- Constants that define protocols, storage keys, or cryptographic formats SHOULD live in one
  reviewed location.

### 4.4 Dependency Injection

- Use framework-native dependency wiring first.
- Introduce a dedicated DI solution only when it clearly reduces complexity.
- Anything that tests need to replace MUST be injectable.

### 4.5 App Initialization Sequence

The startup order matters. Failing to initialize infrastructure in the right order causes silent
crashes in release builds that never appear in debug.

Recommended sequence in `main()`:

1. `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`
2. Platform-specific FFI or native bindings (e.g. `sqfliteFfiInit()` for Windows/Linux desktop)
3. Secure storage or key material bootstrap
4. Database initialization and schema migration
5. App config / flavor loading
6. Logging infrastructure initialization
7. App lifecycle observer registration
8. `runApp(...)`

Document the actual sequence in `docs/architecture.md` for the project.

Each initialization step MUST handle its own failure gracefully and surface a safe error state
rather than crashing silently.

---

## 5. Environment And Build Configuration

This section is optional for `Core Baseline` projects and applies fully under
`Production App Extension`.

### 5.1 When Flavors Are Required

Build flavors are REQUIRED when any of the following is true:

- The app has distinct `dev`, `staging`, or `prod` environments.
- QA needs production-like builds against non-production config.
- Multiple variants must be installed side by side.
- Release behavior differs materially by environment.

If the app has only one environment and no parallel install need, flavors MAY be omitted.

### 5.2 Recommended Flavor Model

A common baseline is `dev` and `prod`.

```dart
enum AppFlavor { dev, prod }

class AppFlavorConfig {
  AppFlavorConfig._(this.flavor);

  static const _flavorValue = String.fromEnvironment(
    'FLUTTER_APP_FLAVOR',
    defaultValue: 'prod',
  );

  static final AppFlavorConfig instance = AppFlavorConfig._(
    _parse(_flavorValue),
  );

  final AppFlavor flavor;

  static AppFlavor _parse(String value) {
    switch (value.trim().toLowerCase()) {
      case 'dev':
        return AppFlavor.dev;
      case 'prod':
      default:
        return AppFlavor.prod;
    }
  }

  bool get isDev => flavor == AppFlavor.dev;
  bool get isProd => flavor == AppFlavor.prod;

  String get appName => isDev ? 'MyApp Dev' : 'MyApp';
  bool get showEnvironmentBanner => isDev;
  bool get enableVerboseLogging => isDev;
}
```

If you use a Dart-define based flavor config, build and run commands MUST pass the same value
explicitly.

```bash
flutter run --flavor dev --dart-define=FLUTTER_APP_FLAVOR=dev
flutter run --flavor prod --dart-define=FLUTTER_APP_FLAVOR=prod
flutter build apk --flavor prod --release --dart-define=FLUTTER_APP_FLAVOR=prod
```

Native Android and iOS flavor names SHOULD stay aligned with the Dart flavor value.

### 5.3 Android Flavor Setup

When Android flavors are used, the project SHOULD define product flavors in
`android/app/build.gradle` or `android/app/build.gradle.kts`.

```kotlin
android {
    flavorDimensions += "environment"
    productFlavors {
        create("dev") {
            dimension = "environment"
            applicationIdSuffix = ".dev"
            versionNameSuffix = "-dev"
        }
        create("prod") {
            dimension = "environment"
        }
    }
}
```

### 5.4 iOS Flavor Setup

When iOS flavors are used, each flavor requires a separate Xcode scheme and xcconfig file pair.

Directory structure:

```text
ios/
|-- Flutter/
|   |-- dev/
|   |   |-- Debug.xcconfig
|   |   `-- Release.xcconfig
|   `-- prod/
|       |-- Debug.xcconfig
|       `-- Release.xcconfig
```

Each xcconfig file should set the bundle identifier and display name override:

```
// ios/Flutter/dev/Debug.xcconfig
#include "Generated.xcconfig"
FLUTTER_TARGET=lib/main.dart
BUNDLE_ID_SUFFIX=.dev
DISPLAY_NAME=MyApp Dev
```

In Xcode, create one scheme per flavor:
- `dev` scheme: uses `Debug.xcconfig` for run, `Release.xcconfig` for archive.
- `prod` scheme: uses `prod/Release.xcconfig` for archive and store submission.

Each flavor SHOULD have its own `Info.plist` overrides for `CFBundleIdentifier` and
`CFBundleDisplayName` using `$(BUNDLE_ID_SUFFIX)` and `$(DISPLAY_NAME)` variables.

Provisioning profiles MUST be set per scheme. Do not share production profiles with dev builds.

### 5.5 Windows Desktop Build Setup

Windows desktop does not use Android product flavors. Environment separation is achieved through
`--dart-define` at build time combined with the `AppFlavorConfig` pattern from section 5.2.

Additional Windows-specific setup required before any DB or FFI work can run:

```dart
// In main() before runApp, for Windows and Linux desktop:
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:sqflite_common_ffi/sqflite_ffi.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  if (Platform.isWindows || Platform.isLinux) {
    sqfliteFfiInit();
    databaseFactory = databaseFactoryFfi;
  }
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

**Window constraints** — set a minimum window size to prevent layouts breaking at small sizes:

```dart
// Using window_manager package
import 'package:window_manager/window_manager.dart';

await windowManager.ensureInitialized();
await windowManager.setMinimumSize(const Size(800, 600));
await windowManager.setTitle('MyApp');
```

**MSIX packaging** for Windows distribution:

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
msix_config:
  display_name: MyApp
  publisher_display_name: YourName
  identity_name: com.yourcompany.myapp
  msix_version: 1.0.0.0
  logo_path: assets/icons/icon.png
  capabilities: 'runFullTrust'
```

Build command:

```bash
flutter pub run msix:create
```

**Keyboard shortcuts** — register app-wide shortcuts using `Shortcuts` and `Actions` widgets at
the root. Document all registered shortcuts in `docs/architecture.md`.

**Context menus** — use `ContextMenuRegion` or `GestureDetector` with `onSecondaryTap` for
right-click context menus on desktop. Do not assume touch-only interaction patterns.

### 5.6 Artifact Selection

Under `Production App Extension`:

- Android: Use split APKs when distributing directly; use `.aab` for Google Play submission.
- iOS: Use `.ipa` exported via Xcode organizer or `flutter build ipa`.
- Windows: Use MSIX for distribution. Raw `.exe` is acceptable for internal tools only.
- Avoid universal release APKs unless there is a specific distribution reason.

`--target-platform` does not replace `--split-per-abi`.

---

## 6. UI And UX Baseline

This section applies to user-facing applications. It is advisory for infrastructure packages.

### 6.1 Theme And Design Tokens

- Use one source of truth for theme configuration.
- Centralize colors, typography, spacing, radius, and motion values.
- Prefer semantic names over raw literals in widgets.
- If the product supports both light and dark themes, both MUST be tested.
- Design token constants SHOULD live in a single reviewed file such as `lib/app/theme/tokens.dart`.
- Never hardcode `Color(0xFF...)` literals inside widget `build` methods; always reference a token.

### 6.2 Widget Structure

- Screens compose flows and sections.
- Reusable widgets belong in shared widget locations only when they are actually shared.
- Widgets MUST NOT own persistence, cryptography, or network behavior.
- Large `build` methods SHOULD be split when readability drops.

### 6.3 Screen-State Guidance

Async and task-oriented screens SHOULD define the states they genuinely need:

1. Loading
2. Empty
3. Success
4. Error

Not every static screen needs all four states. Apply this rule where asynchronous data or user
actions make those states meaningful.

**Loading state pattern:**

- Use a skeleton / shimmer loader for screens that display a list or content-heavy layout. This
  reduces perceived wait time and avoids layout shift.
- Use a centered `CircularProgressIndicator` only for short-lived action feedback (form submission,
  save, delete).
- Never block the entire screen with a spinner for initial data loads that have skeleton
  alternatives available.

### 6.4 User Feedback Components

Use the correct feedback component for each context. Do not substitute freely between them.

| Context | Component | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Non-blocking operation result (save, copy, undo) | `SnackBar` | Dismissable, low interruption |
| Destructive action confirmation | `AlertDialog` | Requires explicit user decision |
| Contextual detail or secondary flow | `BottomSheet` (modal) | Preserves navigation context |
| Persistent form field error | Inline validation text | Closest to the cause |
| Critical system error requiring action | `AlertDialog` | Cannot be dismissed accidentally |
| Transient ambient status | `Banner` or custom overlay | Does not interrupt flow |

Rules:

- `SnackBar` MUST provide an action when the operation is undoable.
- `AlertDialog` for destructive actions MUST use a clearly destructive label on the confirm button
  (e.g. "Delete", not "OK").
- Do not stack multiple modals. Dismiss the current one before presenting another.

### 6.5 Animation Guidelines

Use the Material motion system as the default baseline.

**Duration tokens:**

| Category | Duration | Use |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Extra small | 50 ms | Micro-interactions, checkbox toggle |
| Small | 100 ms | Icon swap, fab expand |
| Medium | 200 ms | Card expand, bottom sheet partial |
| Large | 300 ms | Screen transition, modal open |
| Extra large | 500 ms | Hero or shared-element transition |

**Easing curves:**

- Use `Curves.easeInOut` for elements that stay within the screen bounds.
- Use `Curves.easeOut` for elements entering the screen.
- Use `Curves.easeIn` for elements leaving the screen.
- Use `Curves.fastOutSlowIn` (Material standard) as the default transition curve.

Rules:

- Animations MUST respect `MediaQuery.of(context).disableAnimations`. If `true`, skip or
  complete animations instantly.
- Looping animations MUST be paused when the app is in the background (`AppLifecycleState.paused`).
- Prefer animating `Transform` and `Opacity` over properties that trigger layout recalculation
  (such as `Padding`, `SizedBox` dimensions, or `Align` factors). `Transform` and `Opacity` are
  composited on the GPU and do not trigger layout or paint passes, which makes them cheaper by
  default. Animating layout-affecting properties via `AnimatedPadding`, `AnimatedContainer`, or
  `TweenAnimationBuilder` is a legitimate Flutter pattern and is not prohibited — it requires
  profiling evidence before shipping to confirm the frame budget is met on a mid-range device.
- Use `AnimationController.dispose()` — always dispose controllers in `State.dispose()`.

### 6.6 Haptic Feedback

- Use `HapticFeedback.lightImpact()` for non-destructive confirmations (item selection, toggle).
- Use `HapticFeedback.mediumImpact()` for significant actions (task complete, bookmark added).
- Use `HapticFeedback.heavyImpact()` for destructive or irreversible actions (delete confirmed).
- Use `HapticFeedback.selectionClick()` for navigating through discrete options (picker scroll).
- MUST NOT use haptics for every tap. Reserve for meaningful state changes only.
- Haptic calls SHOULD be wrapped in a platform check; they are no-ops on platforms that do not
  support them but still good practice to guard explicitly.

### 6.7 Keyboard And Scroll Behavior

- All screens with text input MUST be wrapped in a `SingleChildScrollView` or equivalent
  scrollable if the content can overflow when the keyboard is raised.
- Set `resizeToAvoidBottomInset: true` on `Scaffold` (this is the default; do not set it to
  `false` unless there is a documented layout reason).
- Use `keyboardDismissBehavior: ScrollViewKeyboardDismissBehavior.onDrag` on scrollable lists
  to allow keyboard dismissal by dragging.
- The focused field MUST remain visible when the keyboard is raised. Use
  `ScrollController.animateTo` or `Scrollable.ensureVisible` if automatic scroll is insufficient.
- Prefer `TextInputAction.next` for multi-field forms and advance focus programmatically via
  `FocusScope.of(context).nextFocus()`.
- `TextInputAction.done` MUST close the keyboard and trigger form submission or save.

### 6.8 Safe Area And Display Cutout Handling

- Every top-level `Scaffold` MUST be aware of safe areas. The `Scaffold` widget handles this for
  `appBar` and `bottomNavigationBar`. For custom full-screen layouts, wrap content with `SafeArea`.
- Do not hardcode top or bottom padding. Always read from `MediaQuery.of(context).padding`.
- Test layouts on a device or emulator with a display notch, punch-hole camera, and gesture
  navigation bar. These three configurations expose the most common safe-area bugs.
- For edge-to-edge designs on Android 15+: set `SystemChrome.setEnabledSystemUIMode` appropriately
  and ensure `WindowInsetsController` padding is applied to your content via `MediaQuery`.

### 6.9 UX Rules For Production Apps

Under `Production App Extension`:

- Forms MUST validate before submission and show actionable errors.
- Destructive actions MUST require confirmation or provide undo.
- Layouts SHOULD work on common phone sizes (360 dp to 430 dp width) before release.
- Layouts SHOULD also be tested at 600 dp width (small tablet) if the app targets tablets.
- Route definitions SHOULD be centralized.
- Deep links, if supported, SHOULD have integration coverage.
- Every tap target MUST be at least 48 × 48 dp on mobile.
- Every tap target on desktop MUST be at least 32 × 32 dp.

---

## 7. Accessibility Standard

Accessibility is a correctness requirement. These rules apply under `Core Baseline` for all
user-facing features.

### 7.1 Touch Target Sizes

- Minimum interactive target size: **48 × 48 dp** on mobile (Material and platform requirement).
- Minimum interactive target size: **32 × 32 dp** on desktop.
- If the visual widget is smaller than the minimum target, wrap it in a `SizedBox` or use
  `Padding` to expand the hit area without changing the visual appearance.
- Use `debugPaintPointersEnabled = true` in development to verify actual hit areas.

### 7.2 Color Contrast

- Normal text (below 18 sp or 14 sp bold): minimum contrast ratio **4.5 : 1** (WCAG AA).
- Large text (18 sp or above, or 14 sp bold): minimum contrast ratio **3.0 : 1** (WCAG AA).
- Interactive component boundaries and focus indicators: minimum **3.0 : 1** against adjacent colors.
- Never communicate information using color alone. Always pair color with a label, icon, or
  pattern.
- Both light and dark themes MUST independently pass contrast requirements.

### 7.3 Semantics

- Use `Semantics` widgets to provide labels for any custom widget that assistive technology cannot
  infer from its visual content.
- Use `excludeSemantics: true` on decorative images and icons that carry no meaning.
- Custom interactive widgets (gestures, custom painters, canvas) MUST provide `onTap`, `label`,
  and `hint` semantics.
- `Tooltip` widgets automatically contribute to semantics on long-press; use them for icon buttons.
- Use `MergeSemantics` when multiple widgets form a single logical unit (e.g. a list tile with an
  icon and a label).
- Do not suppress semantics on content that communicates state (loading spinners, error badges).

### 7.4 Font And Text Scaling

- All text layouts MUST remain functional and readable at `textScaleFactor` 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0.
  Test these values in the Flutter inspector before release.
- Do not hardcode pixel heights for containers that hold text. Use `IntrinsicHeight`,
  `FittedBox`, or `Flexible` to let text expand.
- `maxLines` clipping SHOULD be accompanied by `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis` and the full
  text available via a tap action or tooltip.
- `allowFontScaling` MUST NOT be set to `false` globally unless there is a documented,
  user-controlled reason (e.g. a font-size setting in the app itself).

### 7.5 Focus And Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive widgets MUST be reachable and activatable via keyboard Tab and Enter on
  platforms that support a physical keyboard (desktop, tablets with keyboard).
- Use `FocusTraversalGroup` to define logical traversal boundaries within complex screens.
- Focus order SHOULD match the visual reading order (top-left to bottom-right for LTR).
- Modal dialogs and bottom sheets MUST trap focus inside themselves until dismissed.
- Use `FocusNode.requestFocus()` to move focus programmatically when a screen or dialog opens.

### 7.6 Screen Reader Testing

Under `Production App Extension`:

- Test critical flows with **TalkBack** on Android before each release.
- Test critical flows with **Narrator** on Windows desktop before each release.
- Test with **VoiceOver** on iOS and macOS if those platforms are supported.
- At minimum: app navigation, primary data entry flow, and error states must be fully operable
  under TalkBack/Narrator.

### 7.7 Compliance Verification Methods

The following named methods are the expected ways to prove accessibility compliance before
shipping. "We checked" is not sufficient — the method used should be recorded in the release
checklist.

**Touch target verification:**
Enable `debugPaintSizeEnabled = true` in a debug build and visually confirm interactive elements
meet the 48 × 48 dp minimum on mobile. Alternatively, enable Flutter DevTools → Widget Details
and inspect `Size` values for interactive widgets.

**Contrast verification:**
Use the [Material Design Color System contrast tool](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/system/how-the-system-works),
the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/), or the
`accessible_colors` pub package to verify foreground/background pairs. Both light and dark themes
must be checked independently. Record the checked pairs and their ratios.

**Semantics verification:**
Enable `SemanticsDebugger` by wrapping the root widget temporarily:
```dart
// In main() for a verification build:
runApp(SemanticsDebugger(child: MyApp()));
```
This renders the semantics tree visually over the UI. Confirm every interactive element has a
readable label and that decorative elements are excluded. Remove before committing.

**Font scaling verification:**
In the Flutter inspector, use the Text Scale slider (or set `textScaleFactor` in a test) to
verify layouts at 1.0×, 1.5×, and 2.0×. No text should be clipped or overflow its container
at any of these values.

---

## 8. Localization And Internationalization

This section applies to all user-facing app repositories. Even single-language apps MUST complete
the minimum setup in 8.1 to avoid widget rendering failures on non-English system locales.

### 8.1 Minimum Setup (All Apps)

Every Flutter app MUST declare `flutter_localizations` delegates and `supportedLocales` in the
root `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp`. Without this, some Material widgets (date pickers, number
inputs, dialog buttons) render incorrectly on devices with non-English system locales.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations.dart';

MaterialApp(
  localizationsDelegates: const [
    GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
    GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
    GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
  ],
  supportedLocales: const [
    Locale('en'),
    // Add additional locales as the app supports them.
  ],
);
```

Add to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_localizations:
    sdk: flutter
  intl: ^0.19.0
```

And in `pubspec.yaml` under `flutter:`:

```yaml
flutter:
  generate: true
```

### 8.2 String Externalization

When the app supports or plans to support more than one language, all user-visible strings MUST
be externalized into ARB files.

Directory structure:

```text
lib/
`-- l10n/
    |-- app_en.arb
    `-- app_es.arb   # Add per supported locale
```

Example ARB file:

```json
{
  "@@locale": "en",
  "appTitle": "My App",
  "@appTitle": { "description": "The application title" },
  "welcomeMessage": "Welcome, {name}",
  "@welcomeMessage": {
    "description": "Greeting shown on the home screen",
    "placeholders": {
      "name": { "type": "String" }
    }
  }
}
```

Generate typed accessors:

```bash
flutter gen-l10n
```

Use in code via `AppLocalizations.of(context)!.appTitle`. Never use raw string literals for
user-visible text in a localized app.

### 8.3 RTL Layout Support

- Never use `left` and `right` for padding, alignment, or positioning of UI elements. Use `start`
  and `end` equivalents: `EdgeInsetsDirectional`, `AlignmentDirectional`, `MainAxisAlignment.start`.
- Use `Directionality` widget tests to verify layouts do not break in RTL mode.
- Icons that carry directional meaning (back arrow, forward arrow) MUST be mirrored in RTL.
  Use `Directionality.of(context)` or set `textDirection` in `Icon` semantics.
- Test RTL by adding `Arabic` or `Hebrew` to `supportedLocales` and switching the device locale.

### 8.4 Locale-Sensitive Formatting

Use the `intl` package for all locale-sensitive formatting. Never use `toString()` on dates,
numbers, or currencies in user-visible strings.

```dart
import 'package:intl/intl.dart';

// Dates
DateFormat.yMMMMd(locale).format(date);       // "April 5, 2025"
DateFormat.Hm(locale).format(time);           // "14:30"

// Numbers
NumberFormat.decimalPattern(locale).format(value);

// Currency
NumberFormat.currency(locale: locale, symbol: '€').format(amount);
```

---

## 9. App Lifecycle Management

### 9.1 WidgetsBindingObserver

Register a `WidgetsBindingObserver` at a high level in the widget tree (typically at the root
provider or app widget level) to respond to system lifecycle events.

```dart
class AppLifecycleService with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  void init() {
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);
  }

  void dispose() {
    WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
  }

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    switch (state) {
      case AppLifecycleState.paused:
        // App moved to background.
        // Trigger app lock if security policy requires it.
        // Pause looping animations.
        // Flush pending write buffers to disk.
        break;
      case AppLifecycleState.resumed:
        // App returned to foreground.
        // Re-check app lock state.
        // Re-subscribe to data sources if needed.
        break;
      case AppLifecycleState.inactive:
        // App partially obscured (incoming call, notification shade).
        // For sensitive apps: obscure screen content.
        break;
      case AppLifecycleState.detached:
        // App is being terminated.
        // Flush any remaining writes.
        break;
      case AppLifecycleState.hidden:
        // App window hidden (desktop).
        break;
    }
  }

  @override
  void didHaveMemoryPressure() {
    // Clear non-critical caches (image cache, computed results).
    PaintingBinding.instance.imageCache.clear();
    PaintingBinding.instance.imageCache.clearLiveImages();
  }
}
```

### 9.2 Required Lifecycle Behaviors

| State | Required Behavior |
|-------|-------------------|
| `paused` | Flush unsaved data to DB; trigger app lock if `Sensitive Data Extension` |
| `paused` | Pause looping animations and background timers |
| `inactive` | Obscure screen content for sensitive apps (apply `IgnorePointer` + blur overlay) |
| `resumed` | Re-validate app lock; refresh time-sensitive UI state |
| `detached` | Finalize any in-progress DB writes; close open file handles |
| Memory pressure | Clear image cache; release non-critical in-memory buffers |

### 9.3 Database And File Handle Safety

- Open database connections MUST be kept open for the app lifetime; do not open and close per
  operation (this is expensive on mobile).
- On `detached`, call the database's close method if the platform supports a clean shutdown.
- File handles opened for writing MUST be flushed and closed before the app moves to `paused`.
- Temporary files SHOULD be cleaned up on `resumed` if the previous session ended abnormally.

## 10. Performance And Rendering Optimization

### 10.1 Frame Budget

The target rendering budget is:

- **60 Hz displays**: 16 ms per frame.
- **90 Hz / 120 Hz displays**: 11 ms / 8 ms per frame.

A frame that exceeds its budget is called a jank frame. Sustained jank above 5% of frames is a
release-blocking regression.

Use `flutter run --profile` and the Flutter DevTools Performance tab to measure jank. Never
profile in debug mode.

### 10.2 Widget Rebuild Optimization

- Prefer `const` constructors on widgets that do not depend on runtime state. The `const`
  constructor rule in `analysis_options.yaml` (`prefer_const_constructors`) enforces this as a
  lint but understanding why matters: `const` widgets are never rebuilt.
- Use `RepaintBoundary` around widgets that update frequently and independently from their
  siblings (animated elements, real-time counters, video frames). This isolates their repaint to
  their own compositing layer.
- Split large `build` methods into focused sub-widgets. Flutter rebuilds the smallest widget
  subtree that calls `setState`. A monolithic build method forces the entire screen to rebuild on
  any state change.
- Use `ValueListenableBuilder`, `StreamBuilder`, or state management selectors (e.g.
  `ref.watch(provider.select(...))` in Riverpod) to scope rebuilds to the specific part of the
  tree that cares about a value change.

### 10.3 List And Grid Performance

- MUST use `ListView.builder`, `GridView.builder`, or `SliverList` with a
  `SliverChildBuilderDelegate` for any list that is unbounded or can grow without a known upper
  limit. The eager-children variants (`ListView(children: [...])`) build every child at layout
  time regardless of visibility; on an unbounded list this is a correctness failure, not just a
  performance concern.
- For lists with a known, fixed upper bound of roughly 20 items or fewer, `ListView(children:
  [...])` is acceptable. Beyond that count, consider `ListView.builder` — the decision point is
  whether all children being built simultaneously causes a measurable frame-time impact on a
  mid-range device.
- Consider `itemExtent` on `ListView.builder` when all items have the same height. This eliminates
  per-item layout measurement and can significantly improve scrolling on long lists. Benchmark
  before committing to a fixed extent, as it precludes variable-height items.
- Use `const` constructors inside list item widgets wherever possible.
- Avoid loading all data into memory for very long lists. Implement pagination or cursor-based
  loading at the repository layer.
- `ListView.separated` is acceptable for short lists with separators but use
  `ListView.builder` with conditional separator rendering for long lists.

### 10.4 Image Handling And Memory

- Never load full-resolution images when a thumbnail or reduced size is sufficient. Use
  `ResizeImage` or specify `cacheWidth` / `cacheHeight` on `Image.asset` and `Image.file`:

  ```dart
  Image.file(
    file,
    cacheWidth: 400,  // Decoded at 400px wide; reduces GPU memory usage.
  )
  ```

- Use WebP format for photographic images. Lossless WebP is typically 25–30% smaller than PNG
  at equal quality; lossy WebP is typically 25–35% smaller than JPEG.
- For icons and simple illustrations, prefer SVG via `flutter_svg` over raster assets. SVGs
  scale without quality loss and add zero resolution variants to the asset bundle.
- Provide `2.0x` and `3.0x` resolution variants for all raster assets used in the UI. Missing
  variants cause blurry rendering on high-density screens.
- Do not load large images in `initState`. Use `FutureBuilder` or an async provider to load
  images off the frame budget.

### 10.5 Isolates And Background Computation

Any operation that risks holding the main isolate for long enough to drop a frame should be
moved off the UI thread. The 16 ms frame budget on a 60 Hz display is the ceiling; operations
approaching or exceeding that budget are candidates for offloading. The following are common
trigger categories — treat them as decision prompts, not automatic thresholds:

- JSON or CSV parsing of large record sets (a rough starting point is a few hundred records on
  older hardware; profile before assuming).
- Encryption or decryption of large payloads.
- Image compression or resizing in Dart.
- Complex data aggregation or transformation at the service layer.

Use `compute()` for simple single-call operations:

```dart
final result = await compute(_parseJsonInBackground, rawJsonString);

List<Todo> _parseJsonInBackground(String json) {
  // Runs in a separate isolate.
  return (jsonDecode(json) as List).map(Todo.fromJson).toList();
}
```

Use `Isolate.spawn` or an `IsolateNameServer` for long-lived background workers.

Profile in `--profile` mode before adding isolate complexity. `compute()` has measurable
spawn overhead for very small payloads; do not add it preemptively to operations that already
complete well within the frame budget.

### 10.6 Startup Performance

- The cold startup time target for release builds is under **2 seconds** to first meaningful
  frame on a mid-range device.
- Use `flutter build apk --analyze-size` or `flutter build appbundle --analyze-size` to track
  binary size after each significant dependency addition.
- Defer non-critical initialization. Services that are not needed on the first screen SHOULD be
  initialized lazily (on first use), not eagerly in `main()`.
- Avoid synchronous disk reads in `main()`. Database migrations and file reads MUST be async.
- Use `flutter run --trace-startup` to measure startup phases during development.

### 10.7 App Size Budget

Under `Production App Extension`:

| Platform | Target | Hard Limit |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Android APK (arm64) | Under 30 MB | 50 MB |
| Android AAB download size | Under 20 MB | 40 MB |
| Windows MSIX | Under 80 MB | 150 MB |

Exceeding the hard limit requires a documented justification in the release checklist.

Track size in CI using `--analyze-size` output. Record the baseline at project start and
diff on each release.

## 11. Error Handling Architecture

### 11.1 Global Error Boundaries

Every Flutter app MUST configure global error handlers in `main()` before `runApp`. Without these,
unhandled errors in release builds crash silently with no user feedback.

```dart
void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Catch Flutter framework errors (widget build errors, rendering errors).
  FlutterError.onError = (FlutterErrorDetails details) {
    AppLogger.error(
      'Flutter framework error',
      error: details.exception,
      stackTrace: details.stack,
    );
    // In release: show safe error screen.
    // In debug: let Flutter's default red screen appear.
    if (kReleaseMode) {
      _showGlobalErrorScreen();
    } else {
      FlutterError.dumpErrorToConsole(details);
    }
  };

  // Catch async errors that escape the widget tree.
  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError = (Object error, StackTrace stack) {
    AppLogger.error('Uncaught async error', error: error, stackTrace: stack);
    return true; // Returning true suppresses the default crash.
  };

  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

### 11.2 Error Classification

Classify errors at the point of catch so that the correct response is taken.

| Class | Definition | Response |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Recoverable** | Operation failed but app state is intact | Show inline message, offer retry |
| **Degraded** | A feature is unavailable but the app is usable | Show banner, disable affected section |
| **Session** | The current session must be reset (lock triggered, corruption detected) | Navigate to safe state (lock screen or home), log detail |
| **Fatal** | App cannot continue safely | Show fatal error screen with restart action, log full detail |

Rules:
- Never escalate a recoverable error to a fatal error screen.
- Never silently swallow an error that changes application state.
- Error messages shown to the user MUST be human-readable and actionable. They MUST NOT contain
  stack traces, internal exception class names, or database error codes.
- Internal error detail (exception type, stack trace, operation context) MUST be logged at the
  service or repository layer regardless of what is shown in the UI.

### 11.3 Repository And Service Layer Error Handling

- Repositories MUST catch datasource-layer exceptions (`SqliteException`, `FileSystemException`,
  etc.) and re-throw typed domain exceptions.
- Define a sealed domain exception hierarchy:

  ```dart
  sealed class AppException implements Exception {}

  final class StorageException extends AppException {
    StorageException(this.message, {this.cause});
    final String message;
    final Object? cause;
  }

  final class ValidationException extends AppException {
    ValidationException(this.field, this.message);
    final String field;
    final String message;
  }
  ```

- Services MUST NOT throw raw `Exception` or `Error`. They MUST throw or return typed domain
  exceptions.
- State layers MUST catch domain exceptions and translate them into UI state (e.g.
  `AsyncError`, a sealed state variant, or an error field on the state object).

### 11.4 UI Error Presentation

- Use the standard four screen states (section 6.3) for asynchronous data loading errors.
- Inline field errors MUST appear below the relevant field, not as a toast.
- Operation errors (save failed, delete failed) MUST use a `SnackBar` with a retry action where
  possible.
- Fatal error screens MUST provide: a human-readable description, a primary action (Restart or
  Go Home), and a secondary action to copy diagnostic info to the clipboard (for support).

---

## 12. Code Generation

Many core packages in the recommended Flutter stack require `build_runner`. This section defines
how code generation is managed.

### 12.1 Required Commands

Run once after cloning or after modifying annotated source files:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Watch mode during development (regenerates on file save):

```bash
dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Always use `--delete-conflicting-outputs`. Without it, stale generated files from a previous run
cause confusing type errors.

Add to `pubspec.yaml` under `dev_dependencies`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.4.0
  freezed: ^2.5.0          # If using freezed models
  json_serializable: ^6.8.0 # If using json annotation
  riverpod_generator: ^2.4.0 # If using riverpod code gen
```

### 12.2 Generated File Policy

The repository MUST declare one of the following policies for generated files and document it in
`README.md`.

**Option A: Commit generated files** (recommended for most apps)

- `*.freezed.dart`, `*.g.dart`, and `*.gr.dart` files are committed to source control.
- Benefit: The repository is always buildable without running `build_runner`. Useful for CI that
  does not run `build_runner` as a separate step.
- Requirement: Generated files MUST be regenerated and committed whenever the source file changes.
  A CI check SHOULD verify generated files are not stale.

**Option B: Exclude generated files** (acceptable for packages or large codebases)

- `*.freezed.dart` and `*.g.dart` are added to `.gitignore`.
- CI MUST run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` before `flutter analyze`
  and `flutter test`.

Whichever option is chosen, it applies to the entire repository. Mixed policies (some files
committed, some ignored) MUST NOT be used.

### 12.3 What NOT To Add To `.gitignore` Unconditionally

The following are sometimes incorrectly excluded. Clarify intent:

| File pattern | Default policy |
|-------------|----------------|
| `*.freezed.dart` | Commit (Option A) or exclude (Option B), not mixed |
| `*.g.dart` | Same as above |
| `.dart_tool/` | EXCLUDE — always. This is machine-local build state. |
| `build/` | EXCLUDE — always. This is build output. |

### 12.4 Freezed Model Pattern

```dart
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';

part 'todo.freezed.dart';
part 'todo.g.dart';

@freezed
class Todo with _$Todo {
  const factory Todo({
    required int id,
    required String title,
    required bool isCompleted,
    required DateTime createdAt,
    DateTime? completedAt,
  }) = _Todo;

  factory Todo.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$TodoFromJson(json);
}
```

Rules:
- Freezed models MUST be immutable. Use `copyWith` for all mutations.
- Do not add mutable fields or `late` properties to freezed classes.
- Freezed union types (sealed classes) MUST use `when` or `maybeWhen` exhaustively at call sites.

---

## 13. Database And Persistence Standard

### 13.1 SQLite Migration Strategy

Schema changes MUST go through versioned migrations. Never modify the table structure in the
`onCreate` callback after the initial version is shipped to users — this only runs for new
installs.

```dart
final database = await openDatabase(
  path,
  version: 3,
  onCreate: (db, version) async {
    await _runMigrations(db, fromVersion: 0, toVersion: version);
  },
  onUpgrade: (db, oldVersion, newVersion) async {
    await _runMigrations(db, fromVersion: oldVersion, toVersion: newVersion);
  },
);

Future<void> _runMigrations(Database db, {
  required int fromVersion,
  required int toVersion,
}) async {
  for (var v = fromVersion + 1; v <= toVersion; v++) {
    await _migrations[v]!(db);
  }
}

final Map<int, Future<void> Function(Database)> _migrations = {
  1: _v1CreateTables,
  2: _v2AddIndexes,
  3: _v3AddNewColumn,
};
```

Rules:
- Migrations are append-only. Never modify a migration that has already been shipped.
- Each migration MUST be atomic. Wrap multi-statement migrations in a transaction.
- Migrations MUST be covered by integration tests that exercise the upgrade path from the minimum
  supported version to the current version.
- The current schema version MUST be documented in `docs/architecture.md`.

### 13.2 WAL Mode

Enable WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode on SQLite databases used in apps. WAL allows concurrent
readers and a single writer without locking, which significantly improves performance under
typical app workloads.

```dart
await database.execute('PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;');
```

Call this once after opening the database. It persists across connections.

### 13.3 Index Strategy

- Add an index on every column used in a `WHERE` clause that filters a table with more than
  approximately 1,000 rows.
- Add a composite index when queries filter on two or more columns together.
- Never index columns that are mutated on every row update (e.g. `updated_at` on a high-frequency
  write table) unless read queries genuinely require it.
- Document indexes in the schema section of `docs/architecture.md`.

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_todos_created_at ON todos(created_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_time_segments_todo_id ON time_segments(todo_id);
```

### 13.4 Data Integrity Rules

- Use foreign keys and enable enforcement: `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;` after opening.
- Define `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `ON DELETE SET NULL` explicitly; never rely on application code
  to clean up orphan records.
- Use `NOT NULL` constraints on all columns that should never be null at the schema level.
- Use `CHECK` constraints for enumeration columns (e.g. `CHECK(status IN ('open', 'done'))`).

---

## 14. Logging Infrastructure

### 14.1 Logging Levels

Use a consistent level taxonomy across the codebase. All logging calls MUST use one of these
levels:

| Level | When To Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `trace` | Extremely detailed: individual DB rows, loop iterations. Dev-only. |
| `debug` | Useful dev context: function entry/exit, query parameters. Dev-only. |
| `info` | Normal significant events: app start, screen load, user action completed. |
| `warning` | Unexpected but recoverable: retry attempted, deprecated path used. |
| `error` | Operation failed: DB write failed, parse error, expected flow broke. |
| `fatal` | App cannot continue: unrecoverable state, data corruption detected. |

### 14.2 Recommended Logger Setup

The standard requires a named logger abstraction with a consistent level taxonomy (section 14.1)
and a defined sensitive-data policy (section 14.3). The implementation details — package choice,
output targets, rotation mechanism — are project decisions. The following is a reference
implementation using the `logger` package. Adapt it to your project's requirements.

```yaml
dependencies:
  logger: ^2.4.0
```

```dart
// lib/core/logging/app_logger.dart
import 'package:logger/logger.dart';

class AppLogger {
  static final Logger _logger = Logger(
    level: AppFlavorConfig.instance.isDev ? Level.trace : Level.info,
    printer: PrettyPrinter(
      methodCount: 2,
      errorMethodCount: 8,
      lineLength: 120,
      colors: AppFlavorConfig.instance.isDev,
      printEmojis: false,
      dateTimeFormat: DateTimeFormat.onlyTimeAndSinceStart,
    ),
    output: AppFlavorConfig.instance.isDev
        ? ConsoleOutput()
        : MultiOutput([ConsoleOutput(), FileOutput(file: _logFile)]),
  );

  static void trace(String message) => _logger.t(message);
  static void debug(String message) => _logger.d(message);
  static void info(String message) => _logger.i(message);
  static void warning(String message, {Object? error}) =>
      _logger.w(message, error: error);
  static void error(String message, {Object? error, StackTrace? stackTrace}) =>
      _logger.e(message, error: error, stackTrace: stackTrace);
  static void fatal(String message, {Object? error, StackTrace? stackTrace}) =>
      _logger.f(message, error: error, stackTrace: stackTrace);
}
```

### 14.3 Logging Rules

- NEVER log: secrets, tokens, passwords, recovery codes, decrypted content, or full database rows
  that may contain PII.
- Log the operation name and error category, not raw exception messages that may contain user data.
- `debugPrint` MAY be used for quick investigative logging but MUST NOT be committed. Use
  `AppLogger.debug()` for committed debug logs. The `avoid_print` lint catches `print` but NOT
  `debugPrint`; treat both as banned in committed code.
- `AppLogger.trace` and `AppLogger.debug` MUST NOT produce output in production builds. Gate them
  behind the flavor config.
- All `error` and `fatal` logs MUST include an `error` object and a `stackTrace` when available.

### 14.4 Log Rotation And File Output

For apps that write logs to disk over extended periods:

- Limit the log file to a maximum of **5 MB**. Rotate to a new file when the limit is reached.
- Retain a maximum of **3 rotated log files** before deleting the oldest.
- Store log files in the app's cache directory (`getApplicationCacheDirectory()`), not the
  documents directory. Cache files may be cleared by the OS under storage pressure.
- Provide a diagnostic log export action in developer or settings UI so logs can be retrieved for
  support without requiring a device connection.

**Important:** The `logger` package's built-in `FileOutput` does not implement log rotation.
It writes to a single file indefinitely. Projects that need rotation must either wrap
`FileOutput` with size-check logic before each write, use a separate log file management
package, or implement rotation as a startup task that checks file size and renames the current
file before opening a new one. Document whichever approach is chosen in `docs/architecture.md §17`.

### 14.5 What To Log At Each Layer

| Layer | What To Log |
|-------|------------|
| `main()` startup | Initialization steps, flavor, platform, app version |
| Repository | Operation name, record count, duration for slow queries (> 50 ms) |
| Service | Significant state transitions, unexpected branch taken |
| State layer | Screen/feature entered, key user action completed |
| Error boundary | Full error class, message, and stack at `error` or `fatal` level |

---

## 15. Security Standard

### 15.1 Core Security Rules

These rules apply to all Flutter apps.

- Never log secrets, tokens, private payloads, or decrypted sensitive data.
- Request only the permissions the app actually uses.
- Ask for permissions at point of use where the platform allows it.
- Production logs SHOULD avoid personal data unless operationally necessary.
- Production builds MUST be compiled with `--obfuscate --split-debug-info=<symbols_path>`.
  Obfuscation renames Dart class and method names in the compiled binary to meaningless
  identifiers. This raises the cost of casual inspection and automated analysis of the release
  binary — an attacker without a decompiler cannot read class or method names directly from the
  binary. It does not prevent a determined reverse engineer with a Dart decompiler from
  reconstructing application logic, but it removes the low-effort attack surface. It also
  marginally reduces binary size as a secondary effect.

### 15.2 Sensitive Data Extension

Apply this section when the app handles authentication factors, private documents, health data,
financial data, recovery codes, or local encrypted stores.

- Sensitive values MUST NOT be stored in `SharedPreferences`.
- Use platform-backed secure storage for keys, tokens, or secret material.
- Use authenticated encryption such as AES-GCM for stored sensitive payloads.
- Never hardcode keys, IVs, salts, recovery passwords, or backup passwords.
- Cryptographic formats SHOULD be versioned so migrations remain possible.
- Clipboard use for secrets SHOULD be time-bounded or explicitly communicated.
- Screenshot and screen-recording protection MUST be enabled:
  - Android: `FlutterWindowManager` or `FLAG_SECURE` via method channel.
  - iOS: Overlay an opaque view in `willResignActive` / `applicationWillResignActive`.
- App lock, background lock, and session-expiry behavior MUST be explicit in app state.
- Export of sensitive data SHOULD be encrypted by default; plaintext export, if allowed, MUST be
  explicit and user-confirmed.
- Backup, recovery, import, and migration flows MUST be tested as critical flows.

### 15.3 OWASP Mobile Top 10 Compliance Checklist

Before each production release, verify the following OWASP Mobile Top 10 controls:

| ID | Risk | Control |
|----|------|---------|
| M1 | Improper Credential Usage | No hardcoded secrets; use secure storage |
| M2 | Inadequate Supply Chain Security | Dependency audit; pin versions in `pubspec.lock` |
| M3 | Insecure Authentication | App lock with proper background/foreground enforcement |
| M4 | Insufficient Input/Output Validation | Validate all user input; sanitize before DB write |
| M5 | Insecure Communication | TLS only for any network traffic; no HTTP |
| M6 | Inadequate Privacy Controls | Data inventory reviewed; no PII in logs |
| M7 | Insufficient Binary Protections | `--obfuscate` applied to release builds |
| M8 | Security Misconfiguration | `android:debuggable=false` verified; permissions minimal |
| M9 | Insecure Data Storage | No sensitive data in `SharedPreferences` or unencrypted files |
| M10 | Insufficient Cryptography | Versioned encrypted formats; secure key derivation |

Mark each item as verified, not applicable, or risk-accepted (with documented justification)
before release sign-off.

### 15.4 Data Retention And Purge Policy

Every app that stores user-generated data MUST define and implement a retention policy.

- Document in `docs/security.md`: what data is stored, how long it is retained, and what triggers
  deletion.
- Provide a user-accessible "Delete all data" action that removes all local app data including
  the database, log files, cached files, and secure storage entries.
- If the app supports account deletion or reset, verify the purge is complete: no residual files
  in the app's documents, cache, or database directories.
- Temporary files (export staging, image resize cache) MUST be deleted within the same session
  they are created.

### 15.5 Logging And Telemetry

Under `Sensitive Data Extension`:

- Use structured logging rather than scattered `print` calls. See section 14 for the full
  logging standard.
- Verbose logging MUST be gated by environment or flavor config.
- Error logs SHOULD contain operation and error context without exposing protected data.

---

## 16. Coding Standards

### 16.1 Formatting And Analysis

- Run `dart format .` before commit.
- New work MUST NOT introduce analyzer issues.
- Repositories SHOULD aim for zero analyzer warnings overall.
- Start from `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml` and add stricter rules deliberately.

Recommended baseline additions:

```yaml
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  rules:
    avoid_print: true
    prefer_single_quotes: true
    prefer_const_constructors: true
    prefer_const_declarations: true
    prefer_final_fields: true
    prefer_final_locals: true
    avoid_unnecessary_containers: true
    sized_box_for_whitespace: true
    use_key_in_widget_constructors: true
    prefer_is_empty: true
    avoid_empty_else: true
    unnecessary_brace_in_string_interps: true
    unnecessary_this: true
    no_duplicate_case_values: true
    avoid_redundant_argument_values: true
    sort_child_properties_last: true
    use_full_hex_values_for_flutter_colors: true
    always_use_package_imports: true
    cancel_subscriptions: true
    close_sinks: true
    use_decorated_box: true
    avoid_bool_literals_in_conditional_expressions: true
    noop_primitive_operations: true
    use_enums: true
```

### 16.2 Size And Complexity Guidance

These are prompts to review, not automatic failures.

| Metric | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| File length | Around 300 lines: consider splitting |
| File length | Around 500 lines: split or justify |
| Function length | Around 50 lines: consider extracting |
| Widget build method | Around 120 lines: consider sub-widgets |
| Parameters per function | More than 5: consider a parameter object |

### 16.3 Naming

- Use `snake_case` for files, `PascalCase` for classes, and `camelCase` for variables and
  functions.
- Suffix state objects with their role where helpful, such as `AccountProvider` or
  `AuthController`.
- Prefer explicit names over abbreviations.

### 16.4 Comments And Error Handling

- Comments SHOULD explain why, not restate what code does.
- TODOs SHOULD include an owner, issue, or clear follow-up context.
- Do not swallow exceptions silently.
- Show user-safe error messages in the UI while preserving internal diagnostic context
  appropriately. See section 11 for the full error handling standard.

### 16.5 Dependencies

- Add dependencies only when they remove meaningful complexity.
- Prefer maintained packages with clear ownership and null-safety support.
- Review transitive risk for packages that handle auth, storage, files, camera, or encryption.
- Remove unused dependencies promptly.
- For offline-only apps: audit every new dependency to verify it does not introduce transitive
  HTTP or network activity. Run `dart pub deps` and inspect for unexpected network packages.

### 16.6 Dependency Audit Cadence

Under `Production App Extension`:

- Run `flutter pub outdated` monthly and before each release. Review major version upgrades
  individually.
- Run `dart pub deps --style=tree` at least quarterly to inspect the full transitive dependency
  tree for unexpected additions.
- Run `flutter pub licenses` before the first public release and on any release that adds new
  dependencies. Verify all transitive licenses are compatible with your distribution model.
- Pin critical security dependencies (encryption, secure storage) to exact versions in
  `pubspec.yaml` and update them deliberately after reviewing changelogs.

---

## 17. Asset Management

### 17.1 Image Format Policy

| Content Type | Required Format | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Photographs, complex gradients | WebP (lossy) | 25–35% smaller than JPEG at equal quality |
| Logos, UI illustrations with transparency | WebP (lossless) or SVG | Smaller than PNG; SVG preferred if vector |
| Icons (monochrome or multi-color) | SVG via `flutter_svg` | Resolution-independent, tree-shakeable |
| Raster fallback (when SVG not viable) | PNG with 2x/3x variants | Only when SVG cannot achieve the result |

Never use JPEG for UI assets that require transparency.

### 17.2 Resolution Variants

Provide `2.0x` and `3.0x` resolution variants for all raster assets used in the UI. Missing
variants cause blurry rendering on high-density screens (most modern phones are 2x–3x).

Directory structure:

```text
assets/images/
|-- hero_banner.webp           # 1x (baseline)
|-- 2.0x/
|   `-- hero_banner.webp       # 2x
`-- 3.0x/
    `-- hero_banner.webp       # 3x
```

Register in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/2.0x/
    - assets/images/3.0x/
```

### 17.3 Icon Font Tree Shaking

Flutter's `--tree-shake-icons` build flag removes unused Material icons from the binary. It
activates automatically in release builds when icons are referenced via `const` constructors.

- Always use `const Icon(Icons.add)`, never `Icon(Icons.add)` with a variable.
- Never reference icon code points via integer literals. The tree shaker cannot analyze integer
  references.
- Custom icon fonts MUST be subset to include only the glyphs actually used. Use a font subsetting
  tool (e.g. `fonttools`, `glyphhanger`) before committing font files.

### 17.4 Font Licensing

- Verify the license of every bundled font before first release.
- OFL (SIL Open Font License) fonts are generally safe for commercial use without modification.
- Google Fonts via the `google_fonts` package fetches fonts at runtime, which violates offline
  requirements. Bundle the font files directly and reference them via `pubspec.yaml` for offline
  apps.
- Document font sources and licenses in `docs/architecture.md` or a `LICENSES` file.

## 18. Testing Standard

### 18.1 Test Levels

| Level | Core Baseline | Production App Extension |
|-------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Unit tests | Required for business logic, models, parsing, validation, and services | Required |
| Widget tests | Required for screens or widgets with meaningful UI logic | Required |
| Integration tests | Optional unless the app has critical end-to-end flows | Required for critical release paths |
| Golden tests | Optional | Optional but recommended for design systems |
| Performance tests | Optional | Required for screens with complex lists or animations |

### 18.2 Test Rules

- `test/` SHOULD mirror `lib/` closely.
- Services, state layers, and models with non-trivial logic SHOULD have corresponding tests.
- Critical math, parsing, migration, and security logic MUST use deterministic vectors where
  available.
- Bug fixes SHOULD add regression tests when feasible.
- Run `flutter test` after code changes that affect Dart behavior.
- Shared test scaffolding SHOULD live in `test/helpers/` or an equally obvious location.
- Database migration tests MUST cover the full upgrade path from version 1 to the current version,
  not just the latest increment.

### 18.3 Test Quality

- Tests MUST be independent.
- Use descriptive test names.
- Mock external systems, not the logic under test.
- Important test files SHOULD be runnable in isolation.
- Coverage trends are useful, but arbitrary percentage gates SHOULD NOT replace judgment.

### 18.4 Performance Testing

Under `Production App Extension`:

- Use `flutter test --profile` with `WidgetTester.runAsync` for widget-level performance checks.
- For frame-rate regression testing, use Flutter's integration test `traceAction` API to collect
  frame timing:

  ```dart
  final timeline = await driver.traceAction(() async {
    // Scroll through a long list.
    await driver.scroll(listFinder, 0, -5000, const Duration(seconds: 2));
  });
  final summary = TimelineSummary.summarize(timeline);
  expect(summary.computePercentileFrameBuildTimeMillis(90), lessThan(16.0));
  ```

- Capture and store performance baseline results. Treat regressions beyond 20% as blocking.

---

## 19. CI Standard

### 19.1 Minimum CI

All active app repositories SHOULD have CI on pull requests or on the merge path to the protected
branch.

Minimum checks:

```yaml
steps:
  - run: flutter pub get
  - run: dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs   # If using code gen
  - run: dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
  - run: flutter analyze
  - run: flutter test
```

### 19.2 Production App Extension

For shipped apps:

```yaml
  - run: flutter test --coverage
  - run: flutter build apk --flavor dev --debug
  - run: flutter build apk --flavor prod --release
      --dart-define=FLUTTER_APP_FLAVOR=prod
      --obfuscate
      --split-debug-info=build/symbols/
  - run: flutter build appbundle --flavor prod --release
      --dart-define=FLUTTER_APP_FLAVOR=prod
      --obfuscate
      --split-debug-info=build/symbols/
```

Additional recommended steps:
- Dependency license check: `flutter pub licenses > licenses.txt && <verify script>`.
- Generated file staleness check (if Option A from section 12.2 is chosen):
  verify that `*.g.dart` and `*.freezed.dart` files match what `build_runner` would produce.
- Artifact size check: compare `--analyze-size` output against the project's size budget from
  section 10.7.

### 19.3 Pre-Commit

A pre-commit hook MAY run formatting and analysis locally, but CI remains the source of truth.

Recommended local pre-commit script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed . || exit 1
flutter analyze --no-pub || exit 1
echo "Pre-commit checks passed."
```

## 20. Git And Repository Hygiene

### 20.1 Branching And Commits

- Protect the main branch for team repositories.
- Use short-lived branches.
- Prefer conventional commit prefixes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`,
  and `build:`.
- Keep commits cohesive.

### 20.2 Never Commit

- Build output such as `build/`, APKs, AABs, generated release artifacts.
- Secrets, keys, keystores, and signing material.
- Local machine configuration files containing credentials or machine-specific paths.
- `.dart_tool/` directory (machine-local build state).
- Debug symbol archives (`*.symbols/` from `--split-debug-info`).

### 20.3 Usually Commit

- `analysis_options.yaml`
- `.gitignore`
- `pubspec.lock` for application repositories
- `*.freezed.dart` and `*.g.dart` if Option A (commit generated files) is chosen — see section 12.2.

### 20.4 Generated File Policy In .gitignore

Add to `.gitignore` regardless of whether generated Dart source is committed:

```gitignore
# Build output
build/
*.apk
*.aab
*.ipa
*.msix

# Debug symbols
*.symbols/

# Machine-local state
.dart_tool/
.flutter-plugins
.flutter-plugins-dependencies

# IDE files (keep .vscode/settings.json committed if it contains project-wide settings)
.idea/
*.iml

# Generated Dart source — REMOVE these lines if Option A (commit generated files) is chosen:
# *.freezed.dart
# *.g.dart
# *.gr.dart
```

## 21. Documentation Standard

### 21.1 Required Documents For App Repositories

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `README.md` | Setup, run, test, and build instructions |
| `docs/architecture.md` | Module boundaries, initialization sequence, schema version, major decisions |
| `docs/release_process.md` | Required for shipped apps |

### 21.2 Recommended Documents

- `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing release history.
- `docs/security.md` for sensitive-data apps.
- `docs/adr/` for architecture decision records that are likely to be revisited.
- Repository-specific AI instructions such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or equivalent.

### 21.3 README Must Include

- Prerequisites (Flutter version, Dart version, platform SDK versions).
- Setup steps from a clean clone to a running app.
- How to run tests.
- How to run code generation (`build_runner`).
- Build commands for each target platform.
- How to add a new database migration.
- Environment variable or `--dart-define` values needed.

## 22. AI Coding Assistant Instructions

When this standard is supplied to an AI coding assistant, the assistant MUST:

### 22.1 Before Writing Code

- Read the existing code before modifying it.
- Identify whether the repo is Tier 1 or Tier 2 and follow the existing structure.
- Identify the existing state-management pattern and follow it.
- Identify which applicability profile is in force for the repository.
- Check the current database schema version before writing any migration.
- Check whether the repository commits or excludes generated files before creating new models.

### 22.2 While Writing Code

- Respect the current project structure unless the task explicitly includes restructuring.
- Do not introduce a second state-management system without a documented reason.
- Do not add boilerplate comments or type annotations to unchanged code.
- Do not invent abstractions for one-time operations.
- Apply the security profile in force; never log secrets or weaken cryptographic behavior.
- Do not use `kDebugMode` or `kReleaseMode` as a substitute for application flavor when the
  project has explicit environments.
- Always add `const` to constructors and widget instantiations where possible.
- Never use `ListView(children: [...])` for lists that can have more than 20 items.
- Never call heavy synchronous work on the main isolate; use `compute()` or `Isolate`.
- Always use `AppLogger` (or the project's logging service), never `print` or `debugPrint`.
- Always add a `Semantics` label to custom interactive widgets.

### 22.3 After Writing Code

- Run `flutter test` after code changes that affect behavior.
- Run `flutter analyze` before considering the task complete.
- Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` after modifying annotated files.
- Add or update tests when logic changes.
- Verify that no secrets, local machine files, or build artifacts are staged.
- Verify that any new database schema change is accompanied by a migration.

---

## 23. Definition Of Done

A task is complete only when all applicable items are true.

### 23.1 Core Baseline

- Architecture boundaries were respected.
- New code follows the repository's chosen state-management pattern.
- Tests were added or updated for changed logic where appropriate.
- `flutter analyze` is clean for the change.
- `flutter test` passes for behavior-affecting code changes.
- `dart format .` produces no required follow-up changes.
- No secrets, build output, or local machine files were added to git.
- Generated files were regenerated if any annotated source was changed.

### 23.2 Production App Extension

- Environment-specific behavior was verified if the change touched it.
- Required CI checks pass.
- User-facing documentation was updated if behavior changed.
- Release builds or flavor builds were verified when the change touched build, config, signing,
  or release behavior.
- No new jank frames introduced on the primary user flow (verified in profile mode if the change
  touched rendering, lists, or animations).
- App size budget was checked if a new dependency was added.

### 23.3 Sensitive Data Extension

- Sensitive data handling was reviewed against the security section.
- Logging was reviewed for protected data exposure.
- Backup, import, export, migration, or recovery paths were tested if touched.
- OWASP checklist items affected by the change were re-verified.

---

## 24. Practical Guidance

- A thin `main.dart` scales better than a smart one.
- Mirrored tests reduce search time and ownership confusion.
- `utils/` is acceptable only when its scope stays clear and small.
- Flavors solve real problems, but not every app needs them on day one.
- Security requirements should be attached to product risk, not copied blindly.
- CI should enforce the boring rules so review can focus on behavior and design.
- `const` is free performance; use it everywhere it compiles.
- Performance regressions are easiest to catch immediately after the change that caused them.
  Profile before merging, not six months later.
- Accessibility failures discovered late in a project are expensive to fix. Add semantics labels
  as you build each widget, not in a post-hoc pass.
- Every unhandled exception that reaches a user is a trust failure. Design error boundaries first.

Treat this document as a baseline plus extensions. Tighten it for higher-risk apps, and relax
optional guidance only with a deliberate reason.
